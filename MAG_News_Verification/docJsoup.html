Turkey earthquake: The eyewitnesses who captured the quake on social media Published 7 minutes ago Share close panel Share page Copy linkAbout sharing Image source, Getty Images Image caption, An aerial view of collapsed buildings in the Turkish city of Hatay By Kirstie Brewer & Paul Kerley BBC News The sheer scale of the devastation of the earthquake and its aftershocks can be seen in social media photos and videos posted by people in Turkey and Syria. Eyewitnesses have also been speaking about what happened. BBC News has been pulling together and verifying information. The tremors of the main quake - which happened at 04:17 local time - were felt more than a hundred miles in each direction from the epicentre - across southern Turkey and in northern Syria. Witnesses described being shaken from their sleep and running to their cars for safety from the damaged buildings. "I have never felt anything like it in the 40 years I've lived," said Erdem, living in the city of Gaziantep. "We were shaken at least three times very strongly, like a baby in a crib." BBC News has been piecing together what happened as the tremors struck and reverberated across Turkey and Syria - using personal testimony and social media posts which we have verified. In one verified tweet a camera pans across smoke-filled scenes of rubble and destruction in Iskenderun, southern Turkey. #WATCH!!!!

"I barely got myself and my family out of the building. We were just coming out of the wreckage when we saw a person reach out through a small gap. The building collapsed on our friend who tried to save them. They have no chance of escape, it collapsed on them completely. We are in a very difficult situation." Videos have emerged showing large fires in southern Turkey, with people claiming the earthquake has caused gas pipelines to burst and burn out of control. The BBC has verified one of the videos as being on the outskirts of the city of Hatay, around 170km from the earthquake epicentre. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·#Earthquake in #Turkey.#Hatay: "Natural gas pipelines in Amik plain in Hatay burst with the force of the earthquake.

"Neighbours got together, it was teamwork. If there was an old lady or an old man who'd come down and you had space in your car, everyone was just getting blankets and sharing them, whatever they could do." The earthquake reduced the city's castle and the Shirvan Mosque to rubble. Gaziantep castle had been one of the country's best-preserved castles dating back to the Roman period.

BBC journalists were able to confirm the location was in Sanilurfa - rather than, according to an earlier social media claim, Aleppo in Syria.
