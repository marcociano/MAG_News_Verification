with "orchestrating a scheme to defraud investors" in the failed
cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The former FTX boss was arrested on Monday.
Mr Bankman-Fried built a "house of cards on a foundation of deception"
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. He said the alleged fraud was a call for
other platforms to comply with US laws. The SEC charged Bankman-Fried
with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. More on this story FTX founder
