<h3> Description </h3>
<p> MAG News Verification is a web browser that helps users browsing within this application to recognize the news circulating on the net, enabling them to distinguish the real ones from the fake ones. The problem arises from the fact that the news circulating on the net is not always reliable and many times it is purposely put out there with the aim of making readers unsafe. Our tool aims to analyze the news requested by users, by entering the URL in the address bar, and provide a percentage of the page's truthfulness processed after a process of careful analysis. The understanding of the results obtained is represented in various ways: mainly through a number representing the percentage of trustworthiness but, as the browser is designed to interact with different categories of users, the understanding of the results obtained is simplified by a representation that allows graphs with percentages to be shown on the right side of the screen. However, the system is not only limited to this, but also offers the possibility of scraping the web page, that is, a more specific analysis that will then be useful for filtering the selectors that compose it.
Finally, it will also be possible to make a report that will allow you to become aware of potential dangers.</p>
